<!-- âœ… What is Asynchronous Code in JavaScript?

By default, JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it executes code line by line, in sequence.
But sometimes, tasks take time (e.g., fetching data from a server, reading a file, waiting for a timer), and we donâ€™t want to block the rest of the code from executing while waiting.

ðŸ‘‰ Asynchronous code allows JavaScript to perform long-running operations in the background, and handle their results when they are readyâ€”without stopping other code from running. -->
